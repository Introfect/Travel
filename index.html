                <p id="newsOne">Greenland on Friday dismissed the notion that it might be up for sale after reports that
                    US
                    President Donald Trump had privately discussed with his advisers the idea of buying the world's
                    biggest
                    island.
                    "We are open for business, but we're not for sale," Greenland's foreign minister Ane Lone Bagger
                    told
                    Reuters.
                    Trump is due to visit Copenhagen in September and the Arctic will be on the agenda during meetings
                    with
                    the prime ministers of Denmark and Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory.
                    Talk of a Greenland purchase was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Two sources familiar
                    with
                    the situation told Reuters that the notion had been laughed off by some advisers as a joke but was
                    taken
                    more seriously by others in the White House.</p>

                <p id="newsTwo">The eruption began late on Sunday within the volcano's caldera, the U.S. Geological
                    Survey said.
                    Because of the location of the erupting lava, no homes were evacuated and there was little risk to
                    the
                    public. The crater, named Halemaumau, is located within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and was home
                    to a
                    longstanding lava lake that was present for years before a 2018 eruption caused it to drain. The
                    eruption continued throughout Monday and scientists said it's hard to know how long it will last.
                    With
                    the water gone, a lava lake was forming in the crater throughout the day.

                <p id="newsThree">The Army has finalised procurement of 12 high-performance patrol boats to enhance its
                    surveillance of large water bodies, including the Pangong Lake in eastern Ladakh where India and
                    China
                    are locked in a border standoff since early May.
                    The Army said it inked a contract with Goa Shipyard Ltd, a state-run public sector undertaking, for
                    12
                    fast patrol boats for surveillance and patrolling of large water bodies, including those in high
                    altitude areas.
                    "Delivery would commence from May 2021," the Army tweeted.
